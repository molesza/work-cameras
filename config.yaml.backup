  # Second camera configuration (added)
  # To add a second camera, we needed to:
  # 1. Create a new entry with a unique name (BakeryCam)
  # 2. Use the same network interface (enp6s0)
  # 3. Use the same target hostname and ports
  # 4. Change the RTSP path to point to channel 2 instead of channel 1
  # 5. Update the resolution to match channel 2 (960x576)
  # 6. Use different server ports to avoid conflicts

# Note: The Docker container automatically assigns:
# - UUID: A unique identifier for each camera
# - MAC: A unique MAC address for each virtual network interface
# - IP: An IP address obtained via DHCP for each virtual network interface
#
# When adding more cameras, make sure to:
# 1. Use a unique name for each camera
# 2. Change the channel number in the RTSP path
# 3. Update the resolution to match the camera's actual resolution
# 4. Use different server ports for each camera to avoid conflicts
